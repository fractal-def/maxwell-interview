This hook runs before every action in every controller even if the action does not use Action Text feature.\r\nAnd there's no way we can skip this hook because the hook has no name.\r\n\r\nI did not attach a patch because I'm not very much familiar with Action Text code base, but I guess there can be some approaches for fixing this issue. Maybe Action Text should instantiate the renderer on demand.\r\n\r\nAnd, for those of you who are running your apps on Rails 6.0.0, the only way that you can avoid this performance regression for now is to stop requiring `action_text/railtie` by doing something like this.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n# config/application.rb\r\n@@ -1,6 +1,23 @@\r\n require_relative 'boot'\r\n\r\n-require 'rails/all'\r\n+%w(\r\n+  active_record/railtie\r\n+  active_storage/engine\r\n+  action_controller/railtie\r\n+  action_view/railtie\r\n+  action_mailer/railtie\r\n+  active_job/railtie\r\n+  action_cable/engine\r\n+  action_mailbox/engine\r\n+  rails/test_unit/railtie\r\n+  sprockets/railtie\r\n+).each do |railtie|\r\n+  begin\r\n+    require railtie\r\n+  rescue LoadError\r\n+  end\r\n+end\r\n```"

It would be very useful if there was a `file` method that returned the backing file object from the service so that you have more flexibility in how you can expose those files.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 5.2.0.beta2\r\n"

It would be very useful if there was a `file` method that returned the backing file object from the service so that you have more flexibility in how you can expose those files.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 5.2.0.beta2\r\n"

        "body": "Your mind boggled that people who write and share software had different needs than you do? I’m not sure that open source is a safe environment for you then. It can’t be healthy to have your mind boggled so frequently 😄\r\n\r\nActive Storage didn’t set up to be a replacement for anything. It, like every other major framework in Rails, was extracted from actual use in a real application. It wasn’t designed on a spec of what other gems or other users might offer or expect.\r\n\r\nThat’s the beauty of open source! We share what we built to serve our own needs, others then share their enhancements based on their needs, and together we get to enjoy the combined fruits of our labor.\r\n\r\nI spoke about how I view that whole process at RailsConf this year. Including a diagnosis and prescription for the acute case of vendoritis you’re exhibiting. Feel free to self medicate for an hour or so: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VBwWbFpkltg\r\n\r\nThen, hopefully endowed with a healthier perspective, you can come back and help us make software together. Free of the misconception that you’re a customer who bought something and is owed anything ❤️"

When parallelize workers is turned off, there's no setup/teardown being done. Just resetting the fixtures.\r\n\r\nFor my 10-core iMac Pro, running a 2-test test suite takes 0.4s without parallelize workers and 6s with parallelize workers.\r\n\r\nWhen I run the entire suite, it's clearly better to run with parallelize workers (13s vs 38s!), but when running a single suite, it's a pain.\r\n\r\nIt seems like we should differentiate between \"./bin/rails test\", which should run with full parallelization, and \"./bin/rails test tests/model/case.rb\", which should not."

Just required the file. And 31 core_ext files out of 119 that we have in 6.0.0.rc2 has been loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n## So, what's wrong with this?\r\n\r\nThese core extensions are all monkey-patches that changes the behavior of the Ruby language core classes. And all those .rb files are implemented to immediately do the monkey-patching without any additional trigger.<br>\r\nThis means, `ActiveSupport::TestCase` changes the behavior of the most fundamental part of not only the framework but also **the test target** just by being loaded.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is way worse than RSpec 2.x. RSpec <= 2 used to be based on global monkey-patches on `Object`, and the team changed that design because they didn't like that aspect of the framework (but for me personally this tiny set of monkey-patches was acceptable trade off for the DSL because I wouldn't write an application that has such weird methods like `should` etc.).\r\n\r\nIn SimpleCov, we once had a problem where the coverage result merger was globally adding a method on `Array` and `Hash`. https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/449<br>\r\nSure, that was not something that a testing tool should do, but I suppose that it probably never caused an actual problem in real world apps.\r\n\r\nI remember that the same kind of thing was happening in IRB, but that was just one method named `default_src_encoding`, so I suppose that method also never actually conflicted or did any harm on Ruby users.\r\nhttps://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/88de87c2952b08d7f264c7788069a9b6c2fa9309\r\n\r\nBut in our case here, the pollution prevails on Kernel, Object, Module, Class, ... and everywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n## So, what's the actual problem for the users?\r\n\r\nFor demonstrating how this would be a problem in real application testing, I brought a very simple one line \"application\" with a testcase.\r\n\r\nHere's the app:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nputs Time.zone\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a test code for the app:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nClass.new(ActiveSupport::TestCase) { def test_time_zone() assert_nothing_raised { p Time.zone }; end }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can even run the test as a oneliner to make sure that the app is healthly running.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ruby -rminitest/autorun -ractive_support -ractive_support/test_case -e 'Class.new(ActiveSupport::TestCase) { def test_time_zone() assert_nothing_raised { p Time.zone }; end }'\r\nRun options: --seed 8456\r\n\r\n# Running:\r\n\r\nnil\r\n.\r\n\r\nFinished in 0.002033s, 491.8839 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.\r\n\r\n1 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that the test is green, we can confidently run the code in production!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ruby -e 'p Time.zone'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n-e:1:in `<main>': undefined method `zone' for Time:Class (NoMethodError)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... :boom::boom::boom:!\r\n\r\nI can easily provide dozens of more example applications. For just one more example, here's an example of how we can build a neat command line app that prints the date of beginning of this month with TDD.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ruby -rminitest/autorun -ractive_support -ractive_support/test_case -e 'Class.new(ActiveSupport::TestCase) { def test_time_zone() assert p(Date.current.beginning_of_month); end }'\r\nRun options: --seed 50066\r\n\r\n# Running:\r\n\r\n#<Date: 2019-08-01 ((2458697j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>\r\n.\r\n\r\nFinished in 0.002045s, 488.9976 runs/s, 488.9976 assertions/s.\r\n\r\n1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, this app works perfectly in the test, but miserably results in the same `NoMethodError`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What happend (or how I broke the CI) in the Rails repo yesterday\r\n\r\nWhile I was navigating the codebase of Active Model, I found a silly test file that requires `active_support/all`. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/d21e5fbc70c54e31b71483452d975448659fac67/activemodel/test/cases/validations/inclusion_validation_test.rb#L4<br>\r\nAccording to the git log, that single line was rudely added by a thoughtless programmer in [this commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/68db6bc431fbff0b2291f1f60ccf974b4eece596) back in 6.years.ago.\r\n\r\nSince Active Model is designed to be a general purpose O/R mapping abstraction layer, it's implemented not by requiring `active_support/all` inside its codebase.<br>\r\nSo, putting `active_support/all` in a test file is absolutely a silly deed. This line changes the way how everything works. \r\n\r\nAnd, as I removed that `require \"active_support/all\"` line and run the test, I saw some tests were failing with `NoMethodError: undefined method year' for 1:Integer`.<br>\r\nWe were lucky enough that the `1.year` invocation was included only in the tests, so I could fix it by simply adding `require \"active_support/core_ext/integer/time\"` in the test helper. 03018cb79be301fb40a57c9ac92a392b1eb8ee61<br>\r\nI said we were lucky because there was a possibility of calling something that is not required from the Active Model codebase but included in `active_support/all`, and in that case it could have been a cause of `NoMethodError` in the users' apps.\r\n\r\nAnd, while working on this bug, I noticed that the test enviroment already has too many Active Support components turned on, even though the Active Model codebase seems not to be requring that much things. Then I came to realize the real problem (which I wrote at the top of this issue).\r\n\r\nAnd so I started working on gradually cleaning up the fat `ActiveSupport::TestCase` class, finding dozens of missing `require` calls here and there.<br>\r\nOne funny change I made was this: 12959dee0f19a8e050dd1236b031c2c690729905<br>\r\nI removed a line requiring `active_support/time` from `active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb` because nothing in that file seems to require Time manipulation. I ran Active Support tests locally and it passed, so I pushed the commit. Then, the CI started to fail (I'm so sorry for that!) in several other unexpected places, like [actionview](4b4bed83e2c68bcd7fb62cb3eb2aa75733043a92), [activejob](dd16e208a61ee19846ee791e851ceaa491f4a8ee), [actionpack](847ad98e0721fd67d0646dfd58f90e643e4a5ca8), and [actionview](92cb55ce19b3d6d308318f15fdc43b1e5fa67f46).\r\n\r\nAll those CI failures could be fixed by adding `require` calls in each appropriate place. But why did this happen? I didn't change anything in those places. I just changed a line in `active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb`, but actionview nor activejob actually do not implicitly `require` that file!\r\n\r\nThe answer for that question in an actionview case is that the `actionview abstract_unit.rb` for the testing is depending on `action_dispatch integration_test.rb` via implicit autoloading, https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionview/test/abstract_unit.rb#L99<br>\r\nthen in `action_dispatch integration_test.rb` it references a constant named `ActionController::TemplateAssertions` https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/testing/integration.rb#L625<br>\r\nand that takes us to `action_controller/test_case.rb` via explicit autoloading https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionpack/lib/action_controller.rb#L58<br>\r\nand then finally in `action_controller/test_case.rb` we're routed to `active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb`. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionpack/lib/action_controller/test_case.rb#L4\r\n\r\nSo, that was a long story showing you the fact that the whole testing environment is that much fragile because it randomly depends on core language extensions without any guideline.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis is what we're currently providing. We're providing a testing toolkit that pollutes all Ruby world objects, for the users to test their apps.<br>\r\nAlso, we're providing a set of framework components none of which explicitly requires all Active Support features but tested only with the monkey-patch full environment (`require \"active_support/all\"` is called only in railtie boot process, and each component in rails such as activesupport, activemodel, activerecord, etc. are designed to be able to selectively included without railtie).<br>\r\nNothing is relyable so far as being tested on a broken test environment like this.\r\n\r\nWe should immediately fix this situation. We have to make a 100% clean testing base class for the users, and run our tests with that for truly \"isolated\" tests.<br>\r\nOur goal is to make sure that none of these dependencies listed here does not pollute Ruby.\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/activesupport/lib/active_support/test_case.rb#L5-L15\r\n\r\nSo far as I roughly investigated, at least these ones are dirty. We probably have to create a cleaner alternative or get rid of each of them.\r\n```\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/setup_and_teardown\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/deprecation\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/constant_lookup\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/time_helpers\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/parallelization\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to solve this by myself, but I'm almost giving up.<br>\r\nSo I'd like to hear your, especially the core members' opinions. /cc @dhh @jeremy @rafaelfranca and the @rails/committers team"

So that you could require, say, the TZ extensions, and you'd only get a partial amount of AS. But to be honest, that optimization is pretty low my list of priorities. I'd not be willing to give up very much to allow piecemeal inclusion of Active Support extensions to get it."

Just required the file. And 31 core_ext files out of 119 that we have in 6.0.0.rc2 has been loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n## So, what's wrong with this?\r\n\r\nThese core extensions are all monkey-patches that changes the behavior of the Ruby language core classes. And all those .rb files are implemented to immediately do the monkey-patching without any additional trigger.<br>\r\nThis means, `ActiveSupport::TestCase` changes the behavior of the most fundamental part of not only the framework but also **the test target** just by being loaded.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is way worse than RSpec 2.x. RSpec <= 2 used to be based on global monkey-patches on `Object`, and the team changed that design because they didn't like that aspect of the framework (but for me personally this tiny set of monkey-patches was acceptable trade off for the DSL because I wouldn't write an application that has such weird methods like `should` etc.).\r\n\r\nIn SimpleCov, we once had a problem where the coverage result merger was globally adding a method on `Array` and `Hash`. https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/449<br>\r\nSure, that was not something that a testing tool should do, but I suppose that it probably never caused an actual problem in real world apps.\r\n\r\nI remember that the same kind of thing was happening in IRB, but that was just one method named `default_src_encoding`, so I suppose that method also never actually conflicted or did any harm on Ruby users.\r\nhttps://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/88de87c2952b08d7f264c7788069a9b6c2fa9309\r\n\r\nBut in our case here, the pollution prevails on Kernel, Object, Module, Class, ... and everywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n## So, what's the actual problem for the users?\r\n\r\nFor demonstrating how this would be a problem in real application testing, I brought a very simple one line \"application\" with a testcase.\r\n\r\nHere's the app:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nputs Time.zone\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a test code for the app:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nClass.new(ActiveSupport::TestCase) { def test_time_zone() assert_nothing_raised { p Time.zone }; end }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can even run the test as a oneliner to make sure that the app is healthly running.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ruby -rminitest/autorun -ractive_support -ractive_support/test_case -e 'Class.new(ActiveSupport::TestCase) { def test_time_zone() assert_nothing_raised { p Time.zone }; end }'\r\nRun options: --seed 8456\r\n\r\n# Running:\r\n\r\nnil\r\n.\r\n\r\nFinished in 0.002033s, 491.8839 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.\r\n\r\n1 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that the test is green, we can confidently run the code in production!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ruby -e 'p Time.zone'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n-e:1:in `<main>': undefined method `zone' for Time:Class (NoMethodError)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... :boom::boom::boom:!\r\n\r\nI can easily provide dozens of more example applications. For just one more example, here's an example of how we can build a neat command line app that prints the date of beginning of this month with TDD.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ruby -rminitest/autorun -ractive_support -ractive_support/test_case -e 'Class.new(ActiveSupport::TestCase) { def test_time_zone() assert p(Date.current.beginning_of_month); end }'\r\nRun options: --seed 50066\r\n\r\n# Running:\r\n\r\n#<Date: 2019-08-01 ((2458697j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>\r\n.\r\n\r\nFinished in 0.002045s, 488.9976 runs/s, 488.9976 assertions/s.\r\n\r\n1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, this app works perfectly in the test, but miserably results in the same `NoMethodError`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What happend (or how I broke the CI) in the Rails repo yesterday\r\n\r\nWhile I was navigating the codebase of Active Model, I found a silly test file that requires `active_support/all`. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/d21e5fbc70c54e31b71483452d975448659fac67/activemodel/test/cases/validations/inclusion_validation_test.rb#L4<br>\r\nAccording to the git log, that single line was rudely added by a thoughtless programmer in [this commit](68db6bc431fbff0b2291f1f60ccf974b4eece596) back in 6.years.ago.\r\n\r\nSince Active Model is designed to be a general purpose O/R mapping abstraction layer, it's implemented not by requiring `active_support/all` inside its codebase.<br>\r\nSo, putting `active_support/all` in a test file is absolutely a silly deed. This line changes the way how everything works. \r\n\r\nAnd, as I removed that `require \"active_support/all\"` line and run the test, I saw some tests were failing with `NoMethodError: undefined method year' for 1:Integer`.<br>\r\nWe were lucky enough that the `1.year` invocation was included only in the tests, so I could fix it by simply adding `require \"active_support/core_ext/integer/time\"` in the test helper. 03018cb79be301fb40a57c9ac92a392b1eb8ee61<br>\r\nI said we were lucky because there was a possibility of calling something that is not required from the Active Model codebase but included in `active_support/all`, and in that case it could have been a cause of `NoMethodError` in the users' apps.\r\n\r\nAnd, while working on this bug, I noticed that the test enviroment already has too many Active Support components turned on, even though the Active Model codebase seems not to be requring that much things. Then I came to realize the real problem (which I wrote at the top of this issue).\r\n\r\nAnd so I started working on gradually cleaning up the fat `ActiveSupport::TestCase` class, finding dozens of missing `require` calls here and there.<br>\r\nOne funny change I made was this: 12959dee0f19a8e050dd1236b031c2c690729905<br>\r\nI removed a line requiring `active_support/time` from `active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb` because nothing in that file seems to require Time manipulation. I ran Active Support tests locally and it passed, so I pushed the commit. Then, the CI started to fail (I'm so sorry for that!) in several other unexpected places, like [actionview](4b4bed83e2c68bcd7fb62cb3eb2aa75733043a92), [activejob](dd16e208a61ee19846ee791e851ceaa491f4a8ee), [actionpack](847ad98e0721fd67d0646dfd58f90e643e4a5ca8), and [actionview](92cb55ce19b3d6d308318f15fdc43b1e5fa67f46).\r\n\r\nAll those CI failures could be fixed by adding `require` calls in each appropriate place. But why did this happen? I didn't change anything in those places. I just changed a line in `active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb`, but actionview nor activejob actually do not implicitly `require` that file!\r\n\r\nThe answer for that question in an actionview case is that the `actionview abstract_unit.rb` for the testing is depending on `action_dispatch integration_test.rb` via implicit autoloading, https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionview/test/abstract_unit.rb#L99<br>\r\nthen in `action_dispatch integration_test.rb` it references a constant named `ActionController::TemplateAssertions` https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/testing/integration.rb#L625<br>\r\nand that takes us to `action_controller/test_case.rb` via explicit autoloading https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionpack/lib/action_controller.rb#L58<br>\r\nand then finally in `action_controller/test_case.rb` we're routed to `active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb`. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/actionpack/lib/action_controller/test_case.rb#L4\r\n\r\nSo, that was a long story showing you the fact that the whole testing enviroment is that much fragile because it randomly depends on core language extensions without any guideline.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis is what we're currently providing. We're providing a testing toolkit that pollutes all Ruby world objects, for the users to test their apps.<br>\r\nAlso, we're providing a set of framework components none of which explicitly requires all Active Support features but tested only with the monkey-patch full environment (`require \"active_support/all\"` is called only in railtie boot process, and each component in rails such as activesupport, activemodel, activerecord, etc. are designed to be able to selectively included without railtie).<br>\r\nNothing is relyable so far as being tested on a broken test environment like this.\r\n\r\nWe should immediately fix this situation. We have to make a 100% clean testing base class for the users, and run our tests with that for truly \"isolated\" tests.<br>\r\nOur goal is to make sure that none of these dependencies listed here does not pollute Ruby.\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f3c68c59ed57302ca54f4dfad0e91dbff426962d/activesupport/lib/active_support/test_case.rb#L5-L15\r\n\r\nSo far as I roughly investigated, at least these ones are dirty. We probably have to create a cleaner alternative or get rid of each of them.\r\n```\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/setup_and_teardown\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/deprecation\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/constant_lookup\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/time_helpers\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/testing/parallelization\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to solve this by myself, but I'm almost giving up.<br>\r\nSo I'd like to hear your, especially the core members' opinions. /cc @dhh @jeremy @rafaelfranca and the @rails/committers team"

        "body": "I appreciate the deep dive, but I disagree with the premise. First of all, I don't consider Active Support's extensions to be pollution, but rather beautification 😄. Active Support offers a Rails-tinted dialect of Ruby, which not only makes the language more pleasant for Rails programmers, but strikes to the very essence of why I love Ruby. That this is possible!\r\n\r\nSo in fact, I'm inclined to go the opposite direction: All of Active Support included all of the time! I don't have much interest in micromanaging the dependencies of Active Support for the frameworks within Rails. I think it's completely reasonable to say that any framework included in Rails is free to rely on any aspect of the Ruby dialect that is Active Support. And that any application that wish to use a Rails framework need to accept that this usage comes with an acceptance of this Ruby dialect."
